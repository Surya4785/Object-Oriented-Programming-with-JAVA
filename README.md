# OOPS in Java ☕

## Introduction
Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPS) is a programming approach based on the concept of objects. It helps in organizing software design around data and behavior, making programs reusable, secure, and easy to maintain. Java is a widely used object-oriented programming language.

## Core Concepts of OOPS

### Class
A class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties and behaviors of an object.

### Object
An object is a real-world entity and an instance of a class that represents data and functionality.

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the mechanism of wrapping data and methods together into a single unit and restricting direct access to data for security.

### Inheritance
Inheritance is the process by which one class acquires the properties and behaviors of another class, promoting code reusability.

### Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows a single method or operation to perform different tasks based on the object or input.

### Abstraction
Abstraction is the concept of hiding internal implementation details and showing only essential features to the user.

## Access Modifiers in Java
- **Public:** Accessible from anywhere  
- **Private:** Accessible only within the class  
- **Protected:** Accessible within the same package or subclasses  
- **Default:** Accessible only within the same package

## Advantages of OOPS
- Improves code reusability  
- Enhances security  
- Makes maintenance easier  
- Supports scalability  
- Models real-world problems efficiently

## Conclusion
OOPS in Java provides a structured way to design programs using real-world concepts, resulting in efficient and manageable software development.
